                  Building a dashboard and reporting system can be a challenging
                  task, especially when it comes to designing and creating
                  tables. As a developer, I have faced many difficulties while
                  building such systems, and I'm sure many of you can relate.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  The journey from one framework to another can be quite
                  overwhelming, as each framework has its own set of features,
                  advantages, and disadvantages. Moreover, moving from one
                  framework to another requires a lot of effort and increases
                  complexity, making it more challenging to work with tables and
                  other react components.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  I used to struggle with tables, and I realized that I needed
                  to create all these components from scratch to make them work
                  seamlessly. However, even after building multiple components,
                  I found that they lacked the desired aesthetic appeal. While
                  the functionality was there, the design was not up to par.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This realization made me seek help from my friend, who is a
                  skilled designer. I discussed my concerns with him, and he
                  agreed to help me with the designing part. Our journey started
                  with brainstorming and sketching different table designs that
                  were aesthetically pleasing and functional.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  We started by identifying the core functionalities that a
                  table should have, such as sorting, filtering, pagination, and
                  searching. We then created a design that was intuitive,
                  responsive, and visually appealing.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  My friend and I collaborated on the project, and we were able
                  to create tables and other react components that not only
                  worked seamlessly but also looked great. The journey was not
                  easy, but it was worth it.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  After designing various tables, we planned to add commonly
                  used but hard to find components to our dashboard and
                  reporting system. These components are still in development,
                  and we will add them in the next few days..
